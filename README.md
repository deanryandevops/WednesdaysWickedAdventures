Online booking system for range of horror themed adventure parks

Project Description:
Wednesdayâ€™s Wicked Adventures The end customer would like an online booking system for range of horror themed adventure parks. Their most popular product is Risky Rollercoaster. The system must take details of customer map them to the themed adventure park of their choice along with a single box for extra set of health and warning checkboxes. The system should be clean and simple. Your team has been tasked with creating the pipeline for the SDLC. You have also been asked to provide a simple prototype page(s) to test the pipeline. The system needs to take into account the usual security requirements. The administrator of the end system (Wednesday or Pugsley) should be able to access detailed information and edit as appropriate. Once the client enters details it should not be able to be changed by the holiday maker. Your customers are representative of real customers. They require a lot but for a small price. They are prone to changing their mind.
